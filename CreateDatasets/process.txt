The process to creating the datastes is as follow:

#first from JoinMarkets.ipynb
1) first we load the json files for each year
2) we map the traceability information from the traceability .csv files to each of the elements
3) save the files in datasets/DatasetsProcessedTraceability

#then we map the ids between the same skills at AssignIds.ipynb
1) load all files from datasets/DatasetsProcessedTraceability
2) assign ids based on a combination of skillname__dev
3) save results on datasets/DatasetsProcessedTraceability/*_ids.csv
